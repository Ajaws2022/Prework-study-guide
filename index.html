        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Allows us to add style to our html elements</li>

          <li>3 types are Inline, Internal, and External</li>

          <li>External sheets are preffered as they provide a link to the css rules rather than a direct embed</li>

          <li>Wildcard symbols such as "*" can be used to apply rules to the entire set of elements</li>

          <li>External .css rules will need to be linked to the html document in order to be visible</li>

          <li>Class Selectors are used to designate property assignments to particular elements</li>

          <li>CSS Rule: selector{property:value; property:value;}</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Introduces decision making and interactivity to web pages</li>

          <li> This is done in script.js documents and uses the Control Flow of Top to Bottom</li>

          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive, this is important to remember when creating variables and functions</li>

          <li>JS uses a variety of tools to accomplish its intuitive nature, these include but are not limited to Variables, let declarations, const. declarations,
            if and else-if statements, for loops, and functions
          </li>

          <li>Variables are named containers that contain data, to be used they must first be declared with the let keyword
              and then given a value that it represents
          </li>

          <li> Variables can contain strings(a sequence of text placed in quotes) 
              Numbers(literal), Boolean (True or False), Arrays (multiple values contained in one variable), and Objects (anything in the scope
              of JavaScript as everything in JS is dealing with objects)
          </li>

          <li>Array variables are iterated over using a zero-index system which labels the first item in the array as [0} then [1]
            and so on for the length of the array
          </li>

          <li>For loops are a handy way to manage how the system iterates an array. Rather than manually typing the same condition for each item in an
            array the code is simply looped to go through the list at its given starting point </li>

          <li>Operators are mathematical symbols used to combine multiple variables for a new value</li>

          <li>Functions are a set of instructions for the computer to perform a specific task labelled as a key word</li>

          <li>Functions can contain if statements and for loops</li>
